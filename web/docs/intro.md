These docs are a work in progress, and as such how I choose to organize things may change over time. For now, here's the skeleton:

- [Environment Setup](/docs/category/environment-setup) - For everything that powers my development environment.

- [Tools](/docs/category/tools) - For all the tools I make use of.

- DevOPs - For all the DevOPs related stuff.

- Project Managment - For all the project management related stuff.
