# PM Playbook

A playbook I use for all things PM.

## Table of Contents

- [Resources/References](#resources-references)

- [Frameworks](#frameworks)

- [Tools](#tools)

## Resources/References

Work on these resources and references.

## Frameworks

### Working backwards

**One line description**: A framework where you assume the product is already built (implementation details are secondary), and you analyze if it really works for the end user, and if it is better than the alternatives.

**Used by**: Amazon, Apple

**Benefits**:

- Customer focused

- Minimizes confusion

- Goal-oriented

**Steps**:

- Draft a mock-press release detailing the following:

	- The problem you are trying to solve

	- Target users

	- Product benefits to the end user

	- Call to action

- Evaluate the opportunity

- Find solutions (and approvals)

- Build a roadmap

- Create a backlog

**Notes**:

This approach can be a good way to come up with new product ideas that may be refined into a viable product after a single pass, however the engineering possibilities aren't taken into account initially, so this strategy is situational to the kind of organization you are in, the timeline and the resources available.

## Tools

- Jira + Confluence + GitHub Issues Integration

- <u>Asana</u> (**For task assignment and tracking ??**)

- Time Tracking with [gtm](https://github.com/git-time-metric/gtm#install-the-latest-gtm-release)

- Commit hooks with [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
